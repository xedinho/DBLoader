This project is a ready-to-build Hexo site. The GitHub Actions workflow will build the site and publish `public/` to `gh-pages`.

Before pushing, replace `<your-username>` in `_config.yml` with your GitHub username.

To deploy: push to GitHub and let Actions run, or build locally and push `gh-pages` branch.
